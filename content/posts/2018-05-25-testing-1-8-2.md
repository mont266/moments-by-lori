Hi all!

Just a little quick first blog entry to show some of my most recent work and give an update on what I have been up to. And in short I have been super busy! In recent months I took on the position of working as part of the media team at Coleraine FC, those who know me personally will know I jumped at the chance as a football lover and lifetime Coleraine fan. I recently shot some images for the new leisure range Coleraine have launched, the Chevron range. Keep an eye out on our gallery over the coming days for the full body of work. A special thanks to my model, Danny Logan, and also to Curry's Funpark Portrush for letting us use their premises to shoot.
